# ftmstorscble
Reads FTMS treadmill speed data and broadcasts it as a BLE running speed and cadence service. If you have an ANT+ USB stick it will also include cadence information along with the running speed from the treadmill.

# Motivation
I have a Garmin Forerunner watch and a Horizon Fitness treadmill, and wanted to find a way for my Garmin to read the current speed from the treadmill instead of guessing it from my ANT+ foot pod. The ideal solution would be that Garmin supports the BLE FTMS profile, but people have been asking for it for years and it's not materialized.

# How to use


# Notes
This is written pretty specific for my scenario, but with some additional effort it could be expanded to work for many more scenarios.
